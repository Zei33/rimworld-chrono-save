  <description>Never lose progress again! Chrono Save adds a real-time autosave system that protects your colony with regular saves based on actual time, not game time.

CORE FEATURES
- Automatic saves every 5 minutes of real time (configurable)
- Works independently of vanilla autosaves - no interference
- Continues saving even when game is paused or at different speeds
- Rotating save system prevents save file buildup

FUNCTIONALITY
- Uses real-world time tracking instead of in-game time
- Creates saves named "Chronosave-X" with rotating numbers
- Saves are standard RimWorld saves - fully compatible with all features
- Minimal performance impact with efficient time tracking

SAVE MANAGEMENT
- Default: 10 rotating chronosaves (Chronosave-1 through Chronosave-10)
- Automatically overwrites oldest save when limit is reached
- Configurable save count (1-25 saves)
- Independent save files won't conflict with manual or auto saves

FLEXIBLE CONFIGURATION
- Save interval: Adjustable from 1 to 60 minutes
- Save count: Choose how many chronosaves to maintain
- Enable/disable toggle: Turn the system on or off as needed
- Access settings through Options → Mod Settings → Chrono Save

PAUSE-FRIENDLY DESIGN
- Saves continue even when game is paused
- Works at all game speeds (1x, 2x, 3x)
- Perfect for long planning sessions or AFK periods</description>
